# E09a-Scripting

This assignment uses Godot to create a simple game where the player is given a paddle, which can be moved with the mouse, and a ball, which will bounce off of the paddle. The ball will bounce against colored tiles, which will disappear when the ball collides with them. We added a scoring system, which is shown with a label. Script is added so that colliding with and eliminating a tile will add points to the player's total points. The player has three lives. When the player uses all of their lives, a "game over" screen appears, which exists in a separate scene. In the "world" scene script, there is a command that directs this action.
